Goal: KMid2 should be comparable with VanBasco Karaoke player, and even win in
some features. See http://www.vanbasco.com/karaokeplayer/

Pending
-------
* Multiplatform backend based on the FluidSynth library. This will require 
several new features from FluidSynth, to be included in a new release. 
* Multiple MIDI output ports. Currently plays to a single output port. This is 
needed by a few MIDI songs requiring more than 16 channels.
